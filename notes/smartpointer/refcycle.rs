//! Rust’s memory safety guarantees make it difficult, but not impossible, to accidentally create memory that is never cleaned up (known as a memory leak). Preventing memory leaks entirely is not one of Rust’s guarantees, meaning memory leaks are memory safe in Rust. We can see that Rust allows memory leaks by using Rc<T> and RefCell<T>: it’s possible to create references where items refer to each other in a cycle. This creates memory leaks because the reference count of each item in the cycle will never reach 0, and the values will never be dropped.
//!
//!
//! The reference count of the Rc<List> instances in both a and b are 2 after we change the list in a to point to b. At the end of main, Rust drops the variable b, which decreases the reference count of the b Rc<List> instance from 2 to 1. The memory that Rc<List> has on the heap won’t be dropped at this point, because its reference count is 1, not 0. Then Rust drops a, which decreases the reference count of the a Rc<List> instance from 2 to 1 as well. This instance’s memory can’t be dropped either, because the other Rc<List> instance still refers to it. The memory allocated to the list will remain uncollected forever.
//!
//!
//! Compared to a real-world program, the consequences of creating a reference cycle in this example aren’t very dire: right after we create the reference cycle, the program ends. However, if a more complex program allocated lots of memory in a cycle and held onto it for a long time, the program would use more memory than it needed and might overwhelm the system, causing it to run out of available memory.
//!
//!
//! Creating reference cycles is not easily done, but it’s not impossible either. If you have RefCell<T> values that contain Rc<T> values or similar nested combinations of types with interior mutability and reference counting, you must ensure that you don’t create cycles; you can’t rely on Rust to catch them. Creating a reference cycle would be a logic bug in your program that you should use automated tests, code reviews, and other software development practices to minimize.
